    Definition

        Script to gather requested files (by their extension) from certain
        media such as flash drives, internal and external hard disks.

    Details

        The main purpose of this script is (or was) the ability to simply get
        and automatically copy all files of a special type from certain media
        to a user-defined target directory.

        All files in the data source will not be changed by the script.

        For each file type a corresponding sub-directory inside the target
        directory will be created.

        The name of the copied files will be tagged with a leading consecutive
        number in the target directory, so in case there are different files
        of the same type and with the same name from different locations, all
        will be gathered as separate files.

        You can remove the leading numbers with a command like this (in this
        example '/tmp/slurp/gathered_data' is the target directory):

            $ find /tmp/slurp/gathered_data -type f > /tmp/filelist
            $ while read line; do \
                mv "$line" "$(echo $line | sed -e 's/[0-9]\{10\}_//g')"; \
              done < /tmp/filelist
            $ rm -f /tmp/filelist

        Notice that if there are multiple files with the same name and the
        numbers will be removed only one file will remain. So, check on that
        first.

        Furthermore, if you want to get sure that this works as expected, you
        may replace the 'mv' command above with "echo" first.

        Anyway, the script was written within a few minutes and thus it is
        pretty cheesy (including "useless use of" code). So, there is a lot of
        stuff that can be improved.

        Feel free to modify!

    Usage

        The script is interactive, just run it on the shell without any
        command-line arguments:

            $ ./slurp.sh
